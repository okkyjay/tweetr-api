# Authenticating requests

Authenticate requests to this API's endpoints by sending an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a **requires authentication** badge in the documentation below.

To get an auth token, create a user via /signup, then use the /login endpoint to get an auth token.
